License-Grant:
 I, Mathias Panzenböck, place this file hereby into the public domain.
 Use it at your own risk for whatever you like. In case there are
 jurisdictions that don't support putting things in the public domain
 you can also consider it to be "dual licensed" under the BSD, MIT and
 Apache licenses, if you want to. This code is trivial anyway. Consider
 it an example on how to get the endian conversion functions on
 different platforms.
FIXME:
 This is a tag for the sole purpose and hope that one day, someone
 searches for "Fixme" (possibly case-sensitive). Thus, the issue in the
 following "Comment" field can be found in both the Debian archive and
 the original project.
Comment:
 This is a comment from the person who wrote this debian/copyright file.
 .
 The licensing was obviously meant to be "use whatever". However, we
 have to mirror it precisely, and verbatim.  I took the freedom to
 interprete the terms "the MIT licenses" as "Expat"; "the BSD licenses"
 as BSD 3-clause; and "the Apache licenses" as Apache 2.0.  I do this
 in order to keep the list reasonably small and close enough. However,
 someone who understands the legal implications should take a close
 look at this.
